## Deployment
Deployment is handled through CDK stack defined in [aws](./aws/) folder.
It's an application load balanced ECS service. 
Deployment is automated through CI/CD. By default the action is triggered only when there are changes on the master branch in the aws folder

To run the deployment manually, run

```bash
cd aws
pip install -r requirements.txt
cdk deploy --all --require-approval never
```
